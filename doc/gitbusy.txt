*gitbusy* Switch between branches without losing your place

INTRO                                                           *gitbusy-intro*

Stash your Vim session using git-stash before switching to another branch.

A snapshot of your session (including staged hunks, undo history, and
`viminfo`/`shada`) is completely stashed in the git repository.  It allows you
to switch between branches mid-work without losing where you left off.


==============================================================================
COMMAND                                                       *gitbusy-command*

								    *:GitBusy*
									 *:GB*
:GitBusy			Switches to a branch if used with an argument.
				Otherwise, prints a list of branches to select
				from.


==============================================================================
CONFIG                                                         *gitbusy-config*

							   *g:gitbusy_git_exe*
g:gitbusy_git_exe		The path to the `git` executable.

				Default: `git`

							   *g:gitbusy_datadir*
g:gitbusy_datadir		The name of the data directory.  This should
				not contain any slashes since it lives in the
				work tree's root.

				Default: `.gitbusy`

							*g:gitbusy_save_shada*
g:gitbusy_save_shada		If enabled, stores the |shada| (Neovim) or
				|viminfo| (Vim) data file.

				Default: `1`

						     *g:gitbusy_short_command*
g:gitbusy_short_command		If enabled, makes the |:GB| command available
				for a streamlined, yet luxurious, experience.

				Default: `0`


==============================================================================
CAVEATS                                                       *gitbusy-caveats*

I consider these to be acceptable caveats.  But, |gitbusy| might not be right
for you if you don't like them.

- Manually using git-checkout may leave dangling stashes.  You'll be
  prompted to delete them before |:GitBusy| will switch branches.
- All buffers must be saved (|nomodified|) in order to switch branches.
- Terminals can't be opened in Neovim in order to switch branches.
- Stashes may become large over time depending on your |viminfo|/|shada|
  options, undo levels, etc.
- You may lose work if you manually/accidentally remove |gitbusy|'s stashes.
  See git-stash's man page about a possible recovery.
- |gitbusy|'s data directory is created at the work tree's root.
- An entry for |gitbusy|'s data directory is ignored by adding an entry to
  `.git/info/exclude`.
- Sessions are saved with the following settings: `buffers`, `curdir`, `folds`,
  `help`, `slash`, `tabpages`, `unix`.  See: |'sessionoptions'|
- Things may get mixed up if the current directory is different from what
  |gitbusy| thinks it should be.
